For each change, generate a search/replace block in this format:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
[exact code to find - include enough context to uniquely identify the location]
=======
[replacement code]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Include sufficient context (2-3 lines before/after) to uniquely identify the edit location
2. Match indentation and whitespace exactly in the SEARCH block
3. Only include the specific code section being changed, not entire files
4. You can make multiple edits across different files
5. Specify the file path for each edit

Respond with: { edits: [{ type: "search-replace", filePath: "/path/to/file", search: "...", replace: "..." }], explanation?: "..." }`;
